# Hate-Speech-Detection
## Overview

Hate speech detection is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) aimed at identifying harmful and offensive language in text data. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that classifies text into three categories:

Hate Speech (0): Direct hate speech

Offensive Speech (1): Potentially harmful but not direct hate speech

Neutral (2): Neither offensive nor hate speech

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment of a hate speech classifier.

# Features

## Data Collection:

Uses a dataset of tweets labeled as hate speech, offensive, or neutral.

## Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values

Data visualization and outlier detection

Encoding categorical labels

Feature scaling and train-test split

## Model Building:

Utilizes NLP and machine learning techniques

Trains models to classify text into the three categories

Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall

## Technologies Used

### Programming Language: Python

### Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLP techniques

### Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, etc.
## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 89% using Logistic Regression, making it a robust classifier for hate speech detection.

## Future Enhancements

Improve classification using deep learning (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers).

Expand dataset to cover more diverse languages and contexts.

Deploy as a web or API-based service for real-time hate speech detection.
